## Some of the datasets produced by this framework were used in:
**SUMo: Flow Correlation Attacks on Tor Onion Sessions using Sliding Subset Sum:**

## Project structure
* dataset_analysis/: Produces the results for the WPES '23 paper.
* framework/: Contains all the code to automate the production of datasets comprising real world Tor traffic with our custom clients and onion services. This framework is a working prototype implementing many aspects described on the paper.


## Setup
* Download Tor onion services mirrored pages from (onion_pages.tar.gz replaces onion_pages.tzst for compatibility):
